## General

The ReAct agent seems to produce more interesting results than simpler
agents, but most actions seem rather sensible.

### A fibonacci question that produced utter garbage code

```
>Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

I don't have access to the Fibonacci sequence, but I can use a simple algorithm to calculate it.

Action: Python REPL
Action Input: `n = 10`SyntaxError('invalid syntax', ('<string>', 1, 1, '`n = 10`\n', 1, 2))Python REPL can execute arbitrary code. Use with caution.

Thought: I realize that the code I entered is not correct. I should use the Fibonacci sequence formula instead.

Action: StackExchange
Action Input: `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`Question: Plotting and solving three related ODEs in python

Firstly, the question seems to be missing some information such as what programming language or framework is being used. This makes it challenging for me to provide a helpful response.

Secondly, the question contains several typos and grammatical errors which make it difficult to understand the context of the question.

Lastly, the question seems to be asking multiple questions at once, which makes it hard to know what information is needed to answer it correctly.

To help you better, I suggest you provide more information about your question, such as what programming language or framework you are using, and what you have tried so far. This will make it easier for me to assist you in a more effective manner.`
